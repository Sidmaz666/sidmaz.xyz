<br><br>
Earlier in my life I have seen people only knowing <b>Windows</b> as an only operating system in existence for desktop PC. I was no different, however I knew that <b>macOS, DOS, SolarisOS</b> exists due to my computer study in <i>school</i>. Never before I have heard of Linux.
<br><br>
I have a bit of interest in <i>hacking and gaming</i>, during the years when I had my laptop, all I did was browse websites, consume contents, install <i>BlueStack</i> on Windows, run<b> Clash of Clans</b> and yeah all good. I always used to ignore how slow my system was, I used to max up the paging file in windows in order to get good performance, and never dared to run and resource consuming games. So, naturally I put a blame on my <b>poor financial condition<i>(which still is)</i></b>, however the harsh reality was that Windows was sucking all of my <i>system resources</i>.
<br><br>
<b>Windows 7</b> was my personal pick for an OS, however I didn't get to enjoy or explore everything, cause that time my PC as damaged and in the name of <b>Laptop Repair</b> from a <i> "Self-proclaimed Mechanic"</i> , I was <b style="color:#D50000">scammed</b>. Well, after <i>3</i> years I somehow managed to get an spare laptop because at that time it was pretty clear <b>I'm not getting my laptop back üòÄ</b>.
<br><br>
However, during that time I learned about cool windows applications such as Rainmeter, Translucent Bar, UXPatcher<i>(or something..)</i> and <b>bat scripting</b>.(I lost the knowledge I gained Once). When I got my laptop back I was feeling quite geeky and was taking interest in hacking, how they do it. There I stumble upon <b>Kali Linux</b>, almost every <i>Youtube Hacking Channel</i> have mentioned it, there I understood that <b>Linux</b> is kinda important for hacking. So, like a normal curious human being, I downloaded the Kali Linux ISO file, flashed it into an USB Stick and I installed it on my first try. Yeah! I wiped everything out, I tried to run it in <b>Virtual Box(VM)</b> but my system couldn't take it, Windows will crash. And there it begins, the era of <b>Distro Hopping</b>.
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:1.2em; color:#26A69A; font-weight: bold;">
  1. <a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a>
</b>
<br><br>
Though before installing Linux Mint, I have used distros such as Ubuntu, Kali Linux and Parrot OS, however Linux Mint was the perfect stable OS for me that I had no issues with and was using it as my daily driver. During that time I distro hopped due to some things I wanted to do I couldn't do due restrictions & limitations that comes to running a <b>Cinnamon Desktop</b>.  
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:1.2em; color:#26A69A; font-weight: bold;">
  2. <a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank">Manjaro Linux</a>
</b>
<br><br>
I hopped to Manjaro Linux to install the <b>xfce</b> Desktop Environment<i>(Yeah, I was that noob or I still am?)</i>. Well, I faced issue with Manjaro touchpad related. So, yeah I distro hopped again, but before that I enjoyed customizing xfce almost to what I wanted using gtk.css and the GUI settings.Custom Keybindings and there I learned the basic terminal commands such as <b>ls, cd, head, tr, sed, grep, wc and much more</b>.
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:1.2em; color:#26A69A; font-weight: bold;">
  2. <a href="https://mxlinux.org/" target="_blank">MX Linux</a>
</b>
<br><br>
When I was disappointed at Manjaro, surely I was not going to install <i>Linux Mint</i> again, therefore I look at this website called <b><a href="https://www.distrowatch.com">Distro watch</a></b>, and I made my mind to install MX Linux.Installed it without any issues, and used for several days, but something was off my mind wasn't settling down there. so I installed Linux Mint again, wanted to more customization I learned about Tiling Window managers, Vim, Terminal File managers, Hotkey Daemon, Polybar and in general I learned a lot about Linux and I got into the rabbit-hole of <b>Desktop Hopping</b>  
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight: bold;">
<a style="color:#64DD17" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(desktop_environment)" target="_blank">[Cinnamon]</a>
</b>
<br><br>
It was and still is my one of the go to <b>Desktop Environment</b> for Linux, it is very consistent and uses very less system resource. though in terms of customization I felt little restrictive, but I could do so many things here that I wouldn't imagine it doing on Windows.
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:1.2em; font-weight: bold;">
<a style="color:#64DD17" href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/" target="_blank">[KDE Plasma] </a>
</b>
<br><br>
KDE Plasma is stunning right out of the box, however I used to customize KDE as much as I can, I didn't learn much about how customize KDE <i>.css</i> file or such. Though KDe was full-featured and fully customizable, it was a little <b>resource heavy</b> and my 4GB laptop with Dual Core AMD Ryzen 3 didn't like it. It crashed randomly, and yeah this freezing and crashing problem was there in the previous <b>Linux distro</b> & <b> Desktop Environment</b>. There I learned about GRUB and kernel parameters. Also, I learned about myself I only wanted to customize certain aspect of my Desktop Environment, but didn't wanted any bloat. I have also tried the <b>Khroknite tiling plugin</b> for KDE, and I was loving the idea of a <b>Tiling window manager</b>.
<br><br>
So, naturally I learned about various Window Managers such as <i>dwm, qtile, xmonad, bspwm, i3</i> and also looked on some minimal Linux distro such as <b>Arch Linux, Debian & Gentoo</b>. while I was in  manjaro I was loving the power of <b>AUR Helper</b> such as <i>paru & yay</i>, there are so many packages available in an arch based distro and you don't have to build the software from <b> source manually</b>. AUR made me think how dumb <i>Flatpack and Snaps</i> are if you think about it, in my mind snap and flatpack are just doing the same thing as adding a <b>ppa</b> and installing the program on a Debian based distro. So, I downloaded the official <b>Arch ISO</b>, flashed it to my USB Stick and tried to installed it. But I couldn't I wasn't that text savvy at that time and things were really confusing when you are at <b>TTY</b>. Connecting to my mobile hotspot was a pain, however <b>Arch Wiki</b> helped me there, I connected to wifi using the <i>iwctl</i> utility. Well, after that everything was a mess, so I switched to <b>ArcoLinuxD</b>, their installer was great I only installed the hings I needed with xfce desktop environment.
<br><br>

<b style="font-size:1.2em; font-weight: bold;">
<a style="color:#64DD17" href="https://xfce.org/" target="_blank">[Xfce4]</a> 
</b>
<br><br>
ArcoLinux was far more greater experience than Manjaro, probably it is because I was learning about Linux constantly, such as the <b> init systems</b><i>(systemd, openrc, runit)</i>, more about the <i>elite Terminal Text Editor</i> <b>Vim</b>, about Kernel modules, using <b>modprobe</b>, about Linux file system, file permissions<i>(sudo,chmod,chown)</i>, about various Linux shells such as <b>zsh(‚ù§Ô∏è), bash, dash, sh and fish</b>, about <b>Display Managers</b> such as <i>Lightdm,gdm,ssdm,ly-tui</i>, and about <b>mkinitcpio</b> to modify kernel images. Damm!! I learned a lot about how computer works, I broke GRUB and Display manager so many times, that now whenever I see issue with grub and lightdm at the back of my hed I already know what should I do to fix it.
<br><br>
This was the time I dabbled into shell scripting, as I mentioned here many times I like customizing, for my xfce4-panel I was searching a plugin to show my <b>IP Address</b> on hover & and <b>Country Flag and Initials</b> on the panel. I found none, checked on github for such project but there was none, so yeah like a normal human being I started learning how to write shell scripts. There I found out that Linux don't care about <b>File Formats</b>. Within a day I was able to write a shell script that worked using the <i>xfce-genmon plugin</i> for xfce4-panel, and I have made a repo for my project on github too, it's called <b><a href="https://github.com/Sidmaz666/-xfce4-genmon-ip-script" target="_blank">-xfce4-genmon-ip-script</a></b>. I knew that's it I'm not leaving Linux now after feeling so powerful. After a month I wanted to be minimal so I installed Qtile Window Manager, checked out other people configs on github, used it and slowly in time I made it my own. The general idea of configuring your Desktop Environment via scripts was so powerful to me and the freedom I felt was amazing, so I uninstalled xfce completely and was slowly getting used to the Tiling window Manager <b>paradigm</b>. so, it begin every day is a new day you learn something new I loved it, I created more shell scripts such <b><a href="https://github.com/Sidmaz666/rw" target="_blank">rw</a>, a shell script to scrape and watch anime from 4Anime.to<i>which is now obfuscated</i></b>.
<br><br>
during the time using ArcoLinux I faced lots of issue with wifi, and random freezes, while researching I finally found out the kernel parameters to resolve the issue, and learned about other techniques such as reloading kernel modules and try using different Linux kernels such as <i>Zen, Mainline, Hardened & LTS</i>. Howvere, in the process of all this I made my system a bloat, and after a update everything was broken, heck I had to install windows for a month I was so frustrated. But luckily my heart was at Linux and for good reasons, this time I did <b>10000 year</b> of research before attempting to wipe out my hard disk and install vanilla arch.
<br><br>

  4. <a href="https://archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> 
</b>
<br><br>
I installed Arch on my system with the help of a Github project <i><a href="https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi" target="_blank">Archfi</a></i>, it wasn't that good of a installer but it did it job, however the script was installing things that I didn't require. I setup qtile as usual, along with xfce, because I was still not there completely though I pimped my terminal using <b>oh-my-zsh & POWERLEVEL10K</b>.
<br><br>
In this period I learned how to use vim and vifm, I configured both to my liking and there I was at the perfect spot where I can interact with the computer effortlessly as how I wanted. However, at the back of my head I knew I have bloated my system and I haven't learned the basic things yet so, this time I booted into the arch ISO, connected to my wifi and by following the Archwiki from my mobile I was able to install ArchLinux, this helped me a lot on understanding how a operating system and BIOS works on quite fundamental level.
<br><br>
I also checked the <i>default arch-installer</i> and it did the job for me though it was quite buggy and confusing. Once, I was confident enough I installed arch on my laptop several time, then setup qtile and all other applications I need without any bloat and I'm happy, daily it gives me  <b>joy</b> when I use my PC. I came to knew about the <b>UNIX/PORN</b> in Reddit<i>(Why didn't I found it before?)</i>, and yeah it was a blast ricing, configuring and maintaining my system and it's still is. Now, I was ready to install <b>ytfzf</b> and watch youtube from terminal and run <i>cmatrix</i> in my terminal to be an <b>"OP Hacker that would take the World down Soon"</b>.

	<p>Hi there those of who you are reading this, my name is <b>Sidhartha Mazumder</b>, as previously explained in an edgy way on my home page, I'm a <i>Computer Science</i> student. I'm from India, the <b>Land of Gods, Assam, Dibrugarh</b></p>
	<br>
	<p>
	I have inherit the <b>Hindu</b> religion, though it is very vauge to address my faith as Hinduism in modern times. However, I'm quite found of our sacred texts and I'm quite aware of my position in this universe. Though I have a name, it's just a name a pointer to address me, but what is me, it's a question even I don't know. I mean, yeah I'm a human right? but am I only human or I'm something else too.<i>What is this human feeling to be something more than what we already are?</i> Well, doing things like building your own website without using any framework and hosting it for your personal interest can make you feel good, these <b>Feel Good Things</b> we do, or what we <b> accomplish</b> is that what define us? Well, all these will be answered once all of humanity will reach <i>Enlightenment</i> due to severe misery or bliss. Anyway thats, just me saying all these things, you better don't bother to think too much about it because no matter what god you believe in or what advance knowledge you use to survive, <b>"All Motion Comes To Rest At Some Point"</b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	Like any other usual country in our world, due to history rich with conflicts and conquers, India is diverse and there are over <i>121</i> languages in India, many tongues are yet not recognized as they should.<br><br>
	My mothertongue is <b>Bengali</b>, however <b>"horur pora akhomiya kotha e besi pati ahisu" </b><i>(from childhood due to my environment I'm used to speak Assamese more than Bengali. Though I'm not good at writing Assamese üò¢)</i>
	</p><br>
	<p>
	Okay, now lets talk about my school, well I had my formal education in the prestigious <b>Don Bosco Higher Secondary School</b>,(Only Boys School, however now there are girls üòÉ). So, yeah I have done my HSLC from Don Bosco, then I went for an admission into SBA but my percentage was too low, so I didn't have a chance there I knew. My sun was <b>Dibrugarh Hanumanbax Surajmall Kanoi College</b>, I went there for my HS and luckily I got chance there. At first I was sad that I didn't got a chance into SBA, but later I found out it was a boon, I got to know there are more to life than just <i>study,job,marrige,death</i>. I studied Science in HS, we had Physics, Chemistry, üçÑ Biology, and Mathematics<b>(I Hate You but I need You)</b>. Learned a lot there.<br><br>
	I passed HS from <b>Kanoi</b> and was about to start my Bachelor Degree in Meerut at <i>"Park"</i>, but I smelled something <b>fishy</b> there so we escaped, me and my friends. Well one of them is surely my friend other one still owes me  some money, he doesn't contact me, I tried to contact him but ughh!!.. <i>Ningendo Kela</i><br><br>
	I wasted one year, in terms of not taking any educational courses from any educational institute. Well, for me it was not wasted I started doing <b>Content Writing</b> as a <i>Freelance job</i>. Moreover, this was the time I was properly introduced to <b>Linux</b> I knew Linux exists, and I have tried GNU/Linux distributions like <b>Kali Linux, Linux Mint, Parrot, MX, Manjaro</b> and much more. However, I never felt the power of Linux in terms of freedom. In these so called wasted years, I have dig so much of Linux and gained so much knowledge I can proudly say that "<b>I Can Exit Out Of Vim and I'm comfortable in TTY</b>". Though there are many times Linux have upset me and it was all my fault for not being used to such environment. 
	<br><br>
	So after a wasted year I tried to get into <b>DHSK College</b> for <i>Bachelor of Computer Application</i>, Luckily I got the chance again and now I'm currently at 3rd Semester.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	As an <b>One Piece </b>fan Linux and <b>FOSS</b> philosophy resonates with me. Therefore, I have dabbled into the world of Free and Open Source Software and also have created my own shell scripts. I was exposed to programming in my school days and <i>BASIC</i> was my first programming language that I took very little interest at that time. However, later I took interest in <i>C</i> and <i>HTML</i>, Well, the interest in C is still there but not productive, but I guess my interest in HTML is still <i>kicking hard</i>.
	<br><br>
	As an Asian, I'm short in modern time, yeah I'm not insecure about it so I'm writing it in my website. If, I have to state the type of my personality I have to say <b>"It Depends On What Anime I'm Currently Watching"</b>. Well, joke aside,<i> I'm kinda pessimistically optimistic person who is lazy with mild-OCD</i>.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	As an hobby I play <b>üé∏ Guitar</b>, for myself <b> Bach , Chopin, Litz, Mozart, Paganini, Francis Tarrega, Emeniem, XXXtentaction, KANNA BOOM, Metallica, Slipknot, SYOD, Ichiko Nito, steve Vai, Paul Glbert, PolyPhia...etc</b> are my musical influencers. I used to teach guitar lessons, but now I have none, and <i>Life Goes On & On & On &</i>, and by now I gues you got my <i>Music Taste</i> Right?

	<p>From my <i>perspective</i> Internet wasn't supposed to be a place like where you have <b>two-three</b> websites, and everyone is making profile there. The idea of Internet was to empower people with technology, not to empower <b>Tech Co-operates</b> with out personal data.<br> <br>
	Moreover, I'm in the process of learning how web works, So yeah, I have created this website to learn <i>Web Development</i>. I'm an <b> independent </b> human now on Internet at-least. It's very <i>convenient</i> to link all my Social Media address to my website and keep everything organized. This site is designed according to my vision, I designed the <b>User-Interface</b> however I saw fit and I think this quite comfy UI<br><br>
	Youtubers such as <b>DistroTube, Luke smith, Bugswriter (I can't name every single one)</b> have influenced me in Linux and in technical aspects, I guesss I will keep evolving.
